Fine-Tuning BERT for Domain-Specific Research Advisory Generation
This project fine-tunes a BERT-based encoder-decoder model to generate concise, context-aware advisory responses for researchers and innovators. Developed as part of the Duke Bass Connections AI Research Team under Dr. Ibrahim Mohedas, the model supports the commercialization of university research — particularly within North Carolina’s Research Triangle region.
Overview
This project is part of a broader effort to design a domain-adapted large language model (LLM) advisory system that assists Duke researchers in navigating the commercialization of technical innovations, such as diffractive acoustic tomography and other engineering or biomedical breakthroughs.
The model prototype demonstrates how a pretrained BERT architecture can be adapted for sequence-to-sequence tasks like:
Research insight generation
Commercialization support
Report and policy summarization
Technology transfer assistance
Code Structure
1. Dataset Preparation
A small demonstration dataset of research-related questions and summaries is created in Python and converted into a Hugging Face Dataset object.
data = {
    "input_text": [...],
    "target_text": [...]
}
dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(pd.DataFrame(data))
2. Tokenization
The BertTokenizerFast is used to preprocess both input and target sequences, with truncation and padding up to 128 tokens.
tokenizer = BertTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
3. Model Definition
A BERT encoder-decoder model is initialized from pretrained bert-base-uncased checkpoints for both the encoder and decoder components.
model = EncoderDecoderModel.from_encoder_decoder_pretrained("bert-base-uncased", "bert-base-uncased")
4. Training Configuration
Training hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs are configured using the Hugging Face TrainingArguments API.
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./llm_advisory_output",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    num_train_epochs=5,
    ...
)
5. Model Training
The model is fine-tuned using the Trainer API, which handles training, evaluation, and logging.
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_dataset,
    eval_dataset=tokenized_dataset,
    tokenizer=tokenizer
)
trainer.train()
Research Context
This work contributes to Duke’s Bass Connections initiative on AI for Innovation Commercialization, which aims to leverage domain-adapted language models to assist researchers in translating university technologies into viable market solutions.
The team curates datasets from client interviews, regional commercialization case studies, and expert advisory sessions to train specialized models that can:
Analyze commercialization challenges
Provide actionable recommendations for research teams
Contextualize insights for the Research Triangle ecosystem
This BERT-based model serves as an early-stage prototype of the advisory system being developed.
Requirements
Install dependencies via pip:
pip install transformers datasets torch pandas
Optional (for GPU acceleration):
pip install accelerate
Output
After training, the fine-tuned model and logs are saved to:
./llm_advisory_output/
./logs/
These directories contain model weights, optimizer states, and training metrics for further evaluation or downstream integration into the advisory platform.
Future Work
Expand training data from ongoing interviews and case studies.
Experiment with larger encoder-decoder architectures (e.g., T5, BART).
Integrate evaluation metrics such as ROUGE or BLEU.
Deploy as part of an interactive advisory interface for Duke researchers.
